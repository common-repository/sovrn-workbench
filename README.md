## Description

The Workbench plugin speeds up your workflow for distributing and promoting your newest content. Take advantage of new mobile optimized formats like Facebook Instant Articles, Google AMP, and Apple News be connecting your pages and letting Workbench do the heavy lifting for you. And once you’ve distributed it, you can use our built-in Share tool to tell your social media followers (Fb, Twitter, G+ etc.) to check out your new article.

Note: This app is still in beta - so there might be a few non-optimal workflows, but all the integrations are solid and secure. We’re working on the workflows for future versions, as well as upgrades for FB Instant Articles, Apple News, and registration.  Workbench v1.3.1 is only compatible with PHP v5.4.0 or newer. If you discover your web host uses an older version of PHP, please ask them to upgrade.
